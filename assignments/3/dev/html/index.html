   		<h1>About The Exhibition</h1>
   		<p><br><br> 
		The world contains an unimaginable amount of information that is rapidly being generated. Information, organized or unorganized flows through various channels and mediums around us, touching all areas of life. It is a representation of the conditions, ideas and subjects that form the basis of our societies. Categorized as “data”, this information makes it possible to unlock new sources of social, economic and political value. <br><br>

		The advent of the internet has converted the vast data into a binary digital form, creating a form of information explosion. The amount of data created and stored over the internet is inconceivable as it keeps growing. But it’s not the amount that is important, what matters is what we can do with it. The complexity and diversity of the data streams requires them to be quantified by fields such as information technology for further evaluation and use. An emerging generation of artists working in the fields of electronic and digital media are also considering visualizing this information for artistic creations.<br> <br>

		“Data for Art” is an online contemporary exhibition that brings together seven artworks by new media artists who are exploring the ‘big data’ for aesthetic and social significance. These artists are being fundamental in blurring the boundaries between art and data, offering an artistic and critical exploration of the digital age we live in. The work of the artists presented in this exhibition can be compared to Kynaston McShine’s exhibition on “information” in 1970, where the artists confront issues of political and social relevance presenting combinations of various forms of art and information technology.<br> <br>

		Data visualization has emerged as a fundamental method amongst artists for classifying movements, patterns and communications in data. “Flight Patterns” by Aaron Koblin creates a striking visual link between the networks in the sky and our lives. This data visualization project traces the airline traffic over the continent of North America as cartography in a video format. It offers an intriguing conjunction between the aerial technologies that form the core of our lifestyles today, yet rarely considered in the complex web of life. It’s as if the video reminds us of what lies deep in our memories; our first flight, an overnight journey or a memory of traveling long distances to see our close ones.<br> <br>

		Another piece of generative art that can be seen as a visualization of our omnipresent surroundings is “Waves” by Matt Roberts. This video and sound installation presents continuous variations of sounds and patterns that reflect the changing conditions of the oceans. The artist uses data from the closest ocean buoy station transformed into sound waves to generate patterns in bowls of water. These patterns are then projected on a screen for a visual impact. Artworks by British artist Stanza also consider environmental data as raw material to create real time visualizations. In “Data Data Data”, Stanza senses the changes in the fabric of our spaces by using a network of sensors to create a visual event. The piece attempts to reveal the emotional state of the cities we live in as a projection of numbers, highlighting the digital framework of our existence.<br> <br>

		Other works by Stanza also consider the emotional state of our metropolis, depicting an evolving view of our urban landscapes. “Urban Generation” lets the viewer imagine a space where every action has a connection to every other action. The video transmits a kaleidoscope of patterns seen in the architecture, traffic and pedestrians, collected in the form of real time footage from 200 CCTV cameras in London. The artwork considers an environment of total surveillance, where public spaces are being continuously governed. The artist attempts to reclaim the ownership of this data by putting it back into a public domain. He urges that, “Surveillance systems make us actors in a giant movie called life. Except we cannot watch it, it’s not on public display.” For artists like Hasan Elahi, surveillance has been a subject of critical exploration. His work explores to surveil himself publicly to satirize the federal intelligence. “Tracking Transience: The Orwell Project ” by Elahi is an obsessive recording of his life events. The artwork is presented in the form of a website that allows the viewer to track his current location and provides with his personal data in the form of images with time or date stamps. The artwork provides a promising scheme on civilian art and provides a platform for “data exhausts”, which are trails of user data left behind on the internet. Jason Salavon’s artwork “Spigot, Babbling Self-Portrait” offers the viewer a video channel installation of a public investigation into his Google searches on the internet. The video illustrates his personal data as words and fluctuating colors, marked with a palpable tension. The artwork stages a theatrical reflection of how a part of our identity is shaped by the virtual environments we live in.<br> <br>

		Finally, “Living Post” is a piece that sits at the intersection of the domains mentioned above; online existence, data visualization, real time data, personal data, theatrics and surveillance. Artists Ben Rubin and Mark Hansen immerse the viewers in a visualization and sonification of conversations happening in chat rooms, message boards in real time over the internet, while the, video documentation augments the abstractness of the conversations displayed in a grid of multiple small screen displays. It fuels the imagination of the viewer to believe that the fragments are telling a story, reassuring the unknown voices that someone is listening. “Listening Post” touches the surface of privacy and surveillance issues but does not explicitly examine them.<br> <br>

		The artworks presented in this exhibition address complex ideas with simple and elegant executions. They provide a platform for issues of social and political relevance today, in an attempt to surface the invisible. By formatting the mesh of data and information in an aesthetic expression, they take a critical look at our society. Each artist is seen tempted to reveal more layers of the incomprehensible records of human activity by asking difficult societal questions. These artworks thus are a testament to the enormous repositories of digital information that surround us in complex, abstract and social forms.<br><br>

	   		<h2>Aaron Koblin (2005-2008, VIDEO)</h2><br>
	   		<p>The video sequence begins at 5.pm EST generating thin lines of planes traversing across the continent. As the night progresses, the lines become fewer, only to increase as the sun rises. The Datasets provided by the Federal Aviation Administration were rendered as arced trajectories to create this video art using processing, adobe after effects and maya. It renders the domestic air traffic data monitored on August 12, 2008 over North America as cartography. A different version of the art allows the user to highlight the altitudes, color coded aircrafts and hubs. However, it refrains one from studying the art closely by a plane or route. Aaron Koblin originally developed the artwork as a series of experiments with colleagues Scott Hessels and Gabriel Dunne at UCLA for the project “Celestial Mechanics”. </p>

	   		<h1>Waves</h1><br>
	   		<h2>Matt Roberts (2011, VIDEO & SOUND INSTALLATION)</h2><br>
	   		<p>Matt Robert’s ‘Waves’ is an exploration of sound vibrations and visual patterns that acts as a mediator between the nature and human. The piece uses real time wave height and period data from wave buoys as a means to generate sounds and images. Using custom software, the data is translated in low frequency sound waves that are used to shake water in bowls creating abstract patterns. The patterns generated on the surface of the water are captured by a video camera and modified to be projected on a wall. The installation invites the viewer to closely experience the constant changing patterns and sounds that reflect the changing conditions of the ocean.</p>

	   		<h2>Stanza (2008, INSTALLATION)</h2><br>
	   		<p>Stanza’s net artworks are known to explore themes of visualization and sonification of real time spaces. “Data Data Data” is a real time visualization of data gathered from sensing the environment. Multiple sensors in a network communicate over proxy servers to measure, light, noise, sound, humidity, and temperature of spaces. The data gathered from the embedded sensors is projected onto the city or building to enable an artistic metaphor of a ‘new’ digital world. The artwork can be viewed online or locally to represent the urban fabric of spaces in numbers.</p>

	   		<h1>Urban Generation</h1><br>
	   		<h2>Stanza (2004, NET ART)</h2><br>
	   		<p>Surveillance has been a central topic of debate in social sciences. Urban Generation is an artwork that reflects upon the patterns we leave as our public / private spaces are being continuously tracked, monitored and displayed without our consent. The artwork is a visual rich with abstract textures and patterns created by capturing “live scenes” on CCTVs scattered throughout London. The data is compiled by using 200 networked cameras to rework the videos into multi layered visual structures. The resulting generative art gives the viewer the ability to experience a city from multiple lenses and perspectives.</p>

	   		<h1>Tracking Transience : The Orwell Project</h1><br>
	   		<h2>Hasan Elahi (2002, WEBSITE & INSTALLATION)</h2><br>
	   		<p>Hasan Elahi’s work examines issues of surveillance, migration, citizenship in the form of websites and exhibitions that have been put together ever since he was a subject of an intensive FBI investigation post 9/11. ‘Tracking Transience’ is a culmination of data generated from the artist’s life in the form of pictures that continuously track his location.  The website <a href="http://www.trackingtransience.net/" style="color:black">www.trackingtransience.net</a> allows the user to track the artist’s location at any given time via the GPS tracker enabled on his phone. It begins with an image of his current location, complimented with a google map earth view of the same. With a preset delay, it switches to a collage of images from various locations the artist has visited recently. The premise of this piece is based on real-life and obsessive recording of events to satirize the federal intelligence. The artwork was also exhibited as a 7-channel media installation at the Sundance Film Festival.</p>

	   		<h1>Spigot (Babbling Self-Portrait)</h1><br>
	   		<h2>Jason Salavon (2010, NET ART)</h2><br>
	   		<p>A series of multi channel video screens document Jason Salvon’s investigation of his Google searches archived since 2007. The real time work provides a visualization of data in two directions, one using literal text, the other using the same information as fluctuating psychedelic data-streams. The visualization is a sample critique of the surveillance culture, where our personal internet history is recorded by entities such as Google. The tension in the artist’s portraits make it it difficult for the viewer to absorb the content.</p>

	   <div id="listening">
	   		<h1>Listening Post</h1><br>
	   		<h2>Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin (2001, INSTALLATION)</h2><br>
	   		<p>‘Listening Post’ is a visual and sonic installation of audible voices crying out in the darkness of the internet, all monotoned by a computer generated voice. The video documentation demonstrates a large array of 231 small displays of text streams arranged in rows and columns, spoken by a voice synthesizer.. The piece immerses the viewers in a sonification and visualization of multiple conversations happening in real time over the internet, each starting with the first few common words of any chat utterance, “I am”, “I like”, “I love”. The visuals start out from the center of the dimply arrangement and randomly fill up the rest. At times you can see fragments of text that are positioned next to each other to give an illusion of an ongoing context.  The artwork represents content, magnitude, and immediacy of virtual communication by pulling data from Internet Relay Chat rooms and online message boards.</p>
